    <h1> No Bake Cookie Recipe </h1>
    <img src="../images/brownies.webp" alt = "Cookie Picture" >
    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> Tasty no-bake cookies made with quick-cooking oats, peanut butter, and cocoa. 
        For best results, start timing when the mixture reaches a full rolling boil; this is the trick to successful cookies. 
        If you boil too long the cookies will be dry and crumbly. 
        If you don't boil long enough the cookies won't form properly. </p>
